We were required to design an album cover for an already existing / broken up band, and I selected Talking Heads from the list of options. The challenge was to create a design for the album you selected that would be suitable for the year 2023 (as many of the bands evidently already have an album cover). </div><div class="font-sans max-w-sm text-black mb-4"> For this project, I chose to emulate the appearance of a cereal box on the front cover, with the back cover featuring an ingredients list. The name of the album I chose is ‘Songs about Building and Food’ and therefore I wanted to create the atmosphere of a supermarket. It&#39;s worth noting that I have mixed feelings about the album cover since we were obligated to create what our teachers deemed appropriate. However, I am not dissapointed with the final result, I just think that there were many other paths I could have taken. </div><div class="pb-86"></div></div><div class="flex pt-41 w-119 absolute top-0 right-105"><img src="'+o+'" alt="Picture 1"><img src="'+r+'" alt="Picture 2"></div></div>',1),l=[c];function d(h,m){return t(),a("div",i,l)}const p=e(n,[["render",d]]);export{p as default};
