During the workshop, I came up with an idea using Photoshop, and it's actually the piece of work I'm most proud of that I made in my first year of studying art school. I edited photos from some of the trips I've taken in my life, incorporating the national fruit of the selected country. The aim was to create an effect where the colors come out beautifully while overlapping with each other, and I think I succeeded in that regard because it's inherently easier with RISO printing than with regular printing as every color needs to be printed seperatelly.
